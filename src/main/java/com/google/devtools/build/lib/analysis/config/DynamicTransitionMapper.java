/**
 * Maps non-{@link PatchTransition} declarations to their implementable equivalents.
 *
 * <p>Blaze applies configuration transitions by executing {@link PatchTransition} instances. But
 * for legacy reasons, not every transition declaration is a {@link PatchTransition}. The most
 * prominent example is {@link ConfigurationTransitionProxy}, which defines its transitions as
 * enums. These transitions are used all over the place. So we need a way to continue to support
 * them.
 *
 * <p>Hence this class.
 *
 * <p>Going forward, we should eliminate the need for this class by eliminating
 * non-{@link PatchTransition} transitions. This is conceptually straightforward: replace
 * declarations of the form {@link RuleClass.Builder#cfg(Transition)} with
 * {@link RuleClass.Builder#cfg(PatchTransition)}. That way, transition declarations "just work",
 * with no extra fuss. But this is a migration that will take some time to complete.
 *
 * {@link ConfigurationTransitionProxy#DATA} provides the most complicated challenge. This is
 * C++/LIPO logic, and the implementation is in C++ rule code
 * ({@link com.google.devtools.build.lib.rules.cpp.transitions.DisableLipoTransition}). But the enum
 * is defined in {@link Attribute}, which is in {@code lib.packages}, which has access to neither
 * rule-specific nor configuration-specific code. Furthermore, many non-C++ rules declare this
 * transition. We ultimately need a cleaner way to inject this rules-specific logic into general
 * Blaze code.
