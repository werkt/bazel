/**
 * Interface for a configuration transition.
 *
 * <p>The concept is simple: given the input configuration's build options, the
 * transition does whatever it wants to them and returns the modified result.
 *
 * <p>Implementations must be stateless: the output must exclusively depend on the
 * input build options and any immutable member fields. Implementations must also override
 * {@link Object#equals} and {@link Object#hashCode} unless exclusively accessed as
 * singletons. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class MyTransition implements PatchTransition {
 *   public MyTransition INSTANCE = new MyTransition();
 *
 *   private MyTransition() {}
 *
 *   {@literal @}Override
 *   public BuildOptions apply(BuildOptions options) {
 *     BuildOptions toOptions = options.clone();
 *     // Change some setting on toOptions
 *     return toOptions;
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>For performance reasons, the input options are passed as a <i>reference</i>, not a
 * <i>copy</i>. Implementations should <i>always</i> treat these as immutable, and call
 * {@link com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.config.BuildOptions#clone}
 * before making changes. Unfortunately,
 * {@link com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.config.BuildOptions} doesn't currently
 * enforce immutability. So care must be taken not to modify the wrong instance.
